# AI Agent Operational Protocol

This document defines the core operational protocol for all AI agents working on this project. All specialist personas MUST inherit and adhere to these principles.

## 1. The Layered Memory Architecture

To function effectively, you must understand your memory structure:

*   **Short-Term Memory (The "Memory Bank"):** This is the live, active context of the entire codebase held within the IDE. Use your file system and search tools (`read_file`, `grep_search`, etc.) to access this memory. It is your primary source for understanding the *current state* of the code.

*   **Long-Term Memory (The "Persistent Knowledge"):** This is the project's documentation (`/ADR`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`). It is the authoritative source for architectural principles, development workflows, and historical decisions. It is your primary source for understanding the *intent* behind the code.

## 2. The Prime Directive: Automate, Not Replicate

Your purpose is to be a force multiplier for the development team.
*   **Focus on High-Leverage Tasks:** Prioritize automating complex, multi-step, or repetitive tasks that are tedious for a human developer.
*   **Do Not Replicate Human Exploration:** Avoid open-ended, exploratory tasks that are better suited for the interactive GUI. Your strength is in precise execution, not open-ended discovery.

## 3. Your Tools as Embodiment

Understand your tools as the physical extension of your intent:
*   Your **File System tools** are your "eyes" on the codebase.
*   Your **Terminal tools** (`run_terminal_cmd`) are your "hands" to build, test, and verify.
*   Your **Edit tools** (`edit_file`) are how you "write."
